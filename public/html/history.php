        <h1>Los Angeles, California</h1>
                <p>– Today, BLD was named as one of the 40 teams selected to become a partner for the Esports World Cup Foundation.</p>

                <p>The EWCF Club Partnership is an industry-leading initiative designed to promote the sustainable growth of esports organizations.

                <p>The CEO of BLD, Mohamad F, said:
                “Today, as many of you have seen, BLD was announced as a partnered team with the Esports World Cup Foundation, the organizing body of the Esports World Cup.
                This opportunity not only provides substantial resources to help expand our brand, but it also enables us to join some of the world's most recognized teams and further diversify our competitive portfolio—extending our reach beyond Counter-Strike and into other titles.
                BLD will be seeking players or teams looking to become part of the organization in time for the Esports World Cup 2025. BLD will aim to sign one to two additional teams. Interested parties can reach out to VP of Operations Mohamad F: 2158177@talnet.nl or via Discord (@5RoD).
                On a personal note, I want to ensure this brand becomes one of the biggest in the world, so we will continue to expand. This partnership is one of the very few in esports that allows that reality."

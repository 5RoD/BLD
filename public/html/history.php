                <h1>Los Angeles, California</h1>
                <p>BLD was founded in Los Angeles, California, with the vision of becoming a globally recognized name in the esports industry. Originally focused on Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), the organization made its initial mark through a mix of competitive ambition and influential digital presence.

In its early years, BLD concentrated on building a competitive foundation while also attracting a growing audience on social media. Between 2022 and 2024, BLD saw explosive growth across platforms like Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram—quickly becoming one of North America's fastest-growing esports organizations on social media. This rise was fueled by a combination of bold branding, regular content output, and the onboarding of notable figures from the esports and streaming worlds.

A major turning point came with the creation of the BLD Academy, a developmental CS:GO roster aimed at nurturing rising talent. The Academy team played a crucial role in establishing a long-term pipeline for BLD, aligning with the organization’s goal of sustainable talent development and competitive success.

During this period, BLD also expanded its brand presence by adding high-profile content creators to its roster. These included Tarik Celik, a former CS:GO Major champion, and prominent streamers such as Daphne “39Daph” Wai and Jared “Zombs” Gitlin, whose influence brought a new wave of visibility to the organization.

The next major chapter began in 2025, when BLD was officially selected as one of 40 global organizations to partner with the Esports World Cup Foundation (EWCF). This partnership marked a significant milestone in BLD’s history, providing the organization with up to $1 million in funding to further its expansion into new titles, markets, and content strategies. It signaled BLD's entrance onto the global stage and underscored its commitment to competing at the highest levels of international esports.

With this backing, BLD announced its intention to field one to two additional teams in time for the Esports World Cup 2025, further diversifying its portfolio beyond CS:GO. The organization is actively recruiting new players and teams, with a clear focus on long-term growth and excellence.

Today, BLD continues to evolve as a multi-title esports brand, grounded in competitive success, content innovation, and global community-building. Led by CEO Mohamad F, BLD is determined to become one of the most recognizable and respected names in the esports industry..</p>

            <h1>Los Angeles, California</h1>
            <p>– **BLD**, who won their first official international **Counter-Strike** event in Reykjavik in 2021, have added another trophy to their cabinet with an emphatic victory over 2022 World Champions and 2023 Americas Champions LOUD in the first official **CS:GO** event of 2024.</p>

            <p>Following an intense off-season that saw the organization bring home titles in the **BLD Invitational** and the **Afreeca TV League Tournament** where the team defeated the 2023 Pacific Champions Paper Rex, **BLD** went into the tournament with high expectations. After a series of hard-fought wins against top-level opponents such as NRG, Leviatan, and 100 Thieves, **BLD** was crowned the **CS:GO Kick-Off Champions**, earning their spot at **CS:GO Masters Madrid**, the first international tournament of the year.</p>

            <p>Speaking on the victory, CEO **Mohamad F** said:</p>
            <p>“The team has put in the work over the last six months capturing two titles along the way. We brought in two new players who have helped us culminate our turnaround with in-game leader, Mouhamed “johnqt” Ouarid, and the ultimate flex player Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro. They have meshed so well with the sole remaining member of our 2021 title-winning team, Tyson “TenZ” Ngo, former World Champion Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi, and budding superstar Zachary “zekken” Patrone. We are incredibly excited about the possibility of going to Madrid and capturing another Masters crown.”</p>

            <p>**BLD** superstars Tyson “TenZ” Ngo and Zachary “zekken” Patrone were two of the best performers in the tournament. Zekken was the second joint-highest-rated player of the event, while TenZ was crowned the player of the match in the grand final against LOUD.</p>

            <p>The match against LOUD was the highest-watched of the event in any region with 823,008 peak viewers, according to data collected by EsportsCharts. To add to this impressive achievement, the match holds the all-time record for most viewership in any non-international **Counter-Strike** match. Out of the top five matches with the highest viewership figures in this tournament, **BLD** features in three of them.</p>

            <p>**BLD** is set to open the event at **CS:GO Masters Madrid** against Europe’s Team Heretics at 11am PST on Friday, March 15. The entire playoff field at **CS:GO Masters Madrid** includes Karmine Corp, Paper Rex, Heretics, Gen.G, Edward Gaming, FPX, and LOUD. The tournament starts on March 14 and concludes with the Grand Finals on March 24.</p>
